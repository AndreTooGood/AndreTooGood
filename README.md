- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndreTooGood. You could call me Dre too lol.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding but it's too difficult and out of my grasp since i'm not paying attention in class with no efforts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C language and Object Oriented Programming viz. java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a nice beginner-friendly project to start off this amazing journey.
- 📫 You can reach me on my instagram @hey_im_andre_
